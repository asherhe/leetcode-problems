# [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/213/conclusion/1227/)

Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new **sorted** list. The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

**Example:**

```
Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
```

## First Solution (Optimal Solution, just shows 1ms for some reason)

Knowing the MergeSort algorithm, this wasn't hard at all. I just wrote a simple program for this, but then I realized that my code kept on returning `null`. Apparently, the initial value for the return value was `null`, and because the current pointer is always advancing, the current pointer (which was originally pointing to the return value) will start pointing to a independent list. To fix this problem, I made the initial value a `ListNode` with an initial value of a normal `ListNode`, where the value didn't matter. The program went about as normal, and in the end, the actual start of the merged would be returned.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode merged = new ListNode();
        ListNode current = merged;
        while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
            if (l1.val > l2.val) {
                current.next = new ListNode(l2.val);
                l2 = l2.next;
            } else {
                current.next = new ListNode(l1.val);
                l1 = l1.next;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }
        if (l1 == null) {
            while (l2 != null) {
                current.next = new ListNode(l2.val);
                current = current.next;
                l2 = l2.next;
            }
        }
        if (l2 == null) {
            while (l1 != null) {
                current.next = new ListNode(l1.val);
                current = current.next;
                l1 = l1.next;
            }
        }
        return merged.next;
    }
}
```
