# [Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/219/classic-problems/1208/)

Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL
Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
- The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on ...
- The length of the linked list is between `[0, 10^4]`.

## First Solution

Like usual, I went about making a two pointer solution (wow, problems are easy with it!). So this one, it had a `odd` pointer, which represented the next place to move a odd node. And also a `cur` pointer, which was a cursor that represented the current odd number being processed. So here it is in code:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode odd = head;
        ListNode cur = head.next;
        while (cur != null && cur.next != null) {
            ListNode newNext = cur.next.next;
            cur.next.next = odd.next;
            odd.next = cur.next;
            cur.next = newNext;
            odd = odd.next;
            cur = cur.next;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```

**Results:**

(Java memory results can greatly fluctuate, but the most memory-efficient solution was the same thought process anyways)
