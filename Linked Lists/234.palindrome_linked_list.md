# [Palindrome Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/219/classic-problems/1209/)

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1->2
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 1->2->2->1
Output: true
```

## First Solution

After thinking of a almost complete solution and trying to program it, I got stuck. After a lot of thinking, I looked at the Discussions, because there's usually something useful there. So I found a really good solution, it was pretty much the same thought process as mine, but I didn't realize that I could reverse the linked list (my solution required me to count backwards). So right after that, I copied down my code from earlier, because there was this other exercise that required you to reverse a linked list. And after a *bit* of debugging, I finally got the code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        fast = head;
        slow = reverseList(slow);
        while (slow != null && fast != null) {
            if (fast.val != slow.val) {
                return false;
            }
            fast = fast.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        return true;
    }

    private static ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current.next != null) {
            ListNode newNext = current.next.next;
            current.next.next = head;
            head = current.next;
            current.next = newNext;
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```

## Second Solution (Does not modify list, more preferable)

After looking at the discussions, I found a solution that does not modify the original linked list, but uses recursion, so uses $O(n)$ memory. However, this is normally more preferable, since it does not modify the original list. How it works is that it has a recursive function that recurses all the way to the very end of the list, where it checks if the current node is equivalent in value to its normal counterpart. It then moves the pointer forwards, and it moves on to the next level of recursion, which is basically moving backwards.

```java
class Solution {
    private ListNode ref;
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        ref = head;
        return checkEquivalent(head);
    }

    private boolean checkEquivalent(ListNode current) {
        if (current == null) return true;
        boolean restOfList = checkEquivalent(current.next);
        boolean currentEqual = current.val == ref.val;
        ref = ref.next;
        return restOfList && currentEqual;
    }
}
```

*(This is a recursive algorithm, so it technically requires $O(n)$ memory.)*
