# [Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/213/conclusion/1225/)

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:

The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:



After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation:

The input multilevel linked list is as follows:

  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

 

**How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:**

We use the multilevel linked list from **Example 1** above:

```
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
```

The serialization of each level is as follows:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
```

To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
[null,11,12,null]
```

Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## First Solution

After pondering this for a while, I realized that this could be easily solved with recursion. Each child list could be recursively solved. So here's the end result:

```java
/*
Thought Process:
Iterate through until child is not null, then recurse on it.
*/

class Solution {
    public Node flatten(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        Node flattened = new Node();
        Node current = flattened;
        while (head != null) {
            current.next = new Node();
            current.next.val = head.val;
            current.next.prev = current;
            current = current.next;
            if (head.child != null) {
                current.next = flatten(head.child);
                current.next.prev = current;
                while (current.next != null) {
                    current = current.next;
                }
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        flattened.next.prev = null;
        return flattened.next;
    }
}
```
