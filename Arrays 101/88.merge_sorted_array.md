# [Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/fun-with-arrays/525/inserting-items-into-an-array/3253/)

Given two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge `nums2` into `nums1` as one sorted array.

**Note:**

- The number of elements initialized in `nums1` and `nums2` are `m` and `n` respectively.
- You may assume that `nums1` has enough space (size that is equal to `m + n`) to hold additional elements from `nums2`.

**Example:**

```
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

**Constraints:**

- `-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^9`
- `nums1.length == m + n`
- `nums2.length == n`

## First Solution (With auxiliary array)

At first, to at least have a working solution, I tried to do the merge from Merge sort with the auxiliary array. This was done by comparing the two currently smallest values in each list, then incrementing the one that is smaller. Note that to make sure that this is in-place, instead of just replacing the value of `nums1` with `=`, we have to maintain that `List` instance, so we have to use `clear()` and `extend()`.

```python
def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n) -> None:
    """
    Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
    """
    # Set markers for both arrays
    i = 0
    j = 0
    
    # Create an array that will become the new num1
    new = []
    
    # Compare the two smallest values in both arrays to decide
    # which to append
    while i < m and j < n:
        if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
            new.append(nums2[j])
            j += 1
        else:
            new.append(nums1[i])
            i += 1
    
    # Deal with the untouched part
    if i >= m:
        new.extend(nums2[j:])
    else:
        new.extend(nums1[i:m])

	# Set nums1 to new without replacing the List object
    nums1.clear()
    nums1.extend(new)
```

## Second Solution (No auxiliary array)

This time, I tried to avoid using the auxiliary array (`new`). So instead, I treated the *imaginary* length `m+n` extension at the end of `nums1` as the new `new`. After completing the same steps, I removed the first `m+n` elements

```python
def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n) -> None:
    """
    Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
    """
    # Set markers for both arrays
    i = 0
    j = 0
    
    # Compare the two smallest values in both arrays to decide
    # which to append
    while i < m and j < n:
        if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
            nums1.append(nums2[j])
            j += 1
        else:
            nums1.append(nums1[i])
            i += 1
    
    # Append the untouched part of the other array
    if i >= m:
        nums1.extend(nums2[j:])
    else:
        nums1.extend(nums1[i:m])

    # Delete the front part
    del nums1[:n+m]
```

**Results:**

## Third Solution (Not my solution, but the best)

The best that I could find that *wasn't cheating by using `sorted()` or `sort()`*. This is efficient both in time and memory. First of all, even though the order of growth is still around $O(n)$, it is still a bit faster, and also uses less variables by counting backwards, eliminating the use of the two pointers, `i` and `j`.

```python
def merge(self, nums1, m, nums2, n) -> None:
    """
    Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
    """
    # Do a backwards merge until nums2 runs dry
	while n > 0:
        # When either nums1 runs dry or the current nums1 value
        # is smaller, take out the one from nums2
        if m <= 0 or nums2[n-1] >= nums1[m-1]:
            nums1[m+n-1] = nums2[n-1]
            n -= 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, take out the one from nums1
            nums1[m+n-1] = nums1[m-1]
            m -= 1
```
