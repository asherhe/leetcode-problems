# [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/511/in-place-operations/3157/)

Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example:**

```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Note**:

1. You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.

## First Solution

Not knowing what to do (my first shot at it failed), I first tried doing it *not* in-place. Using an auxiliary array, and also a pointer to the last inserted zero, I scanned through `nums` (just like most of my other programs, for some reason it's useful to scan through arrays). The contents of the new array were then copied to `nums`. This uses $O(n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, not good for in-place ($O(1)$ space) operations.

```java
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        int[] newArr = new int[nums.length];
        int insertZeroIndex = nums.length - 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                newArr[insertZeroIndex--] = 0;
            } else {
                newArr[i - nums.length + insertZeroIndex + 1] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            nums[i] = newArr[i];
        }
    }
}
```

## Second Solution

The code shown below (not written by me, just the best answer in terms of memory) shows an optimal solution for time and memory (Time: $O(n)$, Memory: $O(1)$). It has two pointers &mdash;Â a fast one and a slow one. The fast one points to the current value, to swap with the slow pointer. This usually points to the place to swap zeros, so swaps should not be done when this points to zero. The slow pointer points to the next swap position. Like this, the zeros gradually move to the end, while the order of the nonzero numbers remains unchanged. 

```java
class Solution {
    public static void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {

        for (int i = 0, lastNonZero = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                continue; // just scan through zeroes
            }

            if (i == lastNonZero) { // from the beginning, both pointers are in sync, and we keep them so until we see the first zero
                lastNonZero++;
                continue;
            }

            nums[lastNonZero++] = nums[i]; // write the number as rightmost non-zero to date
            nums[i] = 0;  // and zero out its original position
        }


    }
}
```

## Third Solution

After reading the other solution, I wrote one myself:

```javascript
class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        for (int copy = 0, cursor = 0; cursor < nums.length; cursor++) {
            if (nums[cursor] == 0) continue;
            if (copy == cursor){
                copy++;
                continue;
            }
            nums[copy++] = nums[cursor];
            nums[cursor] = 0;
        }
    }
}
```

**Results:**
