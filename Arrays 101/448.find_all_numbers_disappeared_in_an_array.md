# [Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/523/conclusion/3270/)

Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ *n* (*n* = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of [1, *n*] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(*n*) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.

**Example:**

```
Input:
[4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

Output:
[5,6]
```

**Hint 1**

This is a really easy problem if you decide to use additional memory. For those trying to write an initial solution using additional memory, think **counters!**

**Hint 2**

However, the trick really is to not use any additional space than what is already available to use. Sometimes, multiple passes over the input array help find the solution. However, there's an interesting piece of information in this problem that makes it easy to re-use the input array itself for the solution.

**Hint 3**

The problem specifies that the numbers in the array will be in the range [1, n] where n is the number of elements in the array. Can we use this information and modify the array in-place somehow to find what we need?

## First Solution

I decided to use a brute-force solution with $O(n)$ space, because I couldn't think of a $O(1)$-space solution. It used a set to keep track of all the values in `nums`, then checked if each number up to `nums.length` was in the set.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDisappearedNumbers(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return new ArrayList<Integer>();
        TreeSet<Integer> contains = new TreeSet<Integer>();
        for (int i : nums) {
            contains.add(i);
        }

        ArrayList<Integer> missing = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++) {
            if (!contains.contains(i)) missing.add((i));
        }
        
        return missing;
    }
}
```

**Results:**

Runtime: 67ms (Too slow to be on the chart)

## Second Solution

After completely breaking down trying to write a solution, I decided to look at the other solution. One solution that was quite good, and came up a lot, was an interesting one. It looped over the array, and every time it found a number, let's say `i`, it negated the value at index `i-1`, to mark it as found. The return value would then be found by counting the amount of positive numbers.

```java
