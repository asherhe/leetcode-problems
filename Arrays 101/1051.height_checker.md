# [Height Checker](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/523/conclusion/3228/)

Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.

Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.

Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their seats.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Current array : [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Target array  : [1,1,1,2,3,4]
On index 2 (0-based) we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this student.
On index 4 (0-based) we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this student.
On index 5 (0-based) we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this student.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= heights.length <= 100`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 100`

## First Solution

After looking at other solutions, I wrote my own. It sorted the heights, then counted the time something was different.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        int count = 0;
        int[] ordered = heights.clone();
        Arrays.sort(ordered);
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            if (heights[i] != ordered[i]) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Results:**

## Second Solution (Best Solution)

After thinking for a while (unsuccessfully), I decided to look at the other answers.  The best one there had a `count` variable, to keep track of the amount of out-of-place heights. And using an array, it kept track of the occurrences of each height. It also had a `cur` variable which was a cursor for the height-to-occurrence list. When the current object was different from the current number, `count` was incremented. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int heightChecker(int[] arr) {
        int[] temp = new int[101];
        for(int i : arr){
            temp[i]++;
        }
        int cur = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
            while(temp[cur] == 0){
                cur++;
            }
            if(arr[i] != cur){
                count++;
            }
            temp[cur]--;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

**Results:**

*(Note: The memory usage of this is $O(1)$, but is only visibly better for larger $n$. For smaller $n$, the first algorithm is better)*
