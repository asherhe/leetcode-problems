# [Valid Mountain Array](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/527/searching-for-items-in-an-array/3251/)

Given an array `A` of integers, return `true` if and only if it is a *valid mountain array*.

Recall that A is a mountain array if and only if:

- `A.length >= 3`

- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < A.length - 1` such that:

  - `A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i]`
  - `A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,1]
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,5,5]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [0,3,2,1]
Output: true
```

**Note:**

1. `0 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10000 `

## First Solution

First, I wrote a program that looked at the slope of the mountain (the sign of the difference between values). It then iterated through the slopes to verify if it was a true mountain array. I also had to define `sign`, which works like this: In Python, `False = 0` and `True = 1`. If `x` is negative, the result will be `False - True = 0 - 1 = -1`. If `x` is zero, the result will be `False - False`, which is zero. Similarly, if `x` is positive, `True - False = 1`.

```python
sign = lambda x: (x > 0) - (x < 0)

class Solution:
    def validMountainArray(self, A: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(A) < 3: return False
        lastSign = 1
        if sign(A[1] - A[0]) != 1: return False
        for i in range(len(A))[1:]:
            diff = sign(A[i] - A[i-1])
            if diff == 0: return False
            if (lastSign == -1 and diff == 1): return False
            lastSign = diff
        if lastSign != -1: return False
        return True
```

## Second Solution

The second solution first searched for the index of `i`, then determined whether the two slopes were strictly increasing/decreasing.

```python
class Solution:
    def validMountainArray(self, A: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(A) < 3: return False
        
        # Find the "peak" of the mountain
        i = A.index(max(A))

        # Determine whether i is actually a peak
        if i == 0 or i == len(A) - 1: return False

        # Find out if the ascending slope is strictly increasing
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            if A[j] - A[j-1] <= 0: return False

        # Find out if the descending slope is strictly decreasing
        for j in range(i + 1, len(A)):
            if A[j] - A[j-1] >= 0: return False
        
        return True
```

## Third Solution (Not my solution)

This was the fastest solution on the list. From what I understood from this, it first looked for the "peak" of the "mountain". Then, knowing that all of the items before the peak were in ascending order, it would check if the remaining were in descending order.

```python
class Solution:
    def validMountainArray(self, A: List[int]) -> bool:
        if A == [] or len(A) == 1 or len(A) == 2:
            return False
        peak = -inf
        for i, num in enumerate(A):
            if num > peak:
                peak = num
            else:
                break
        if peak == A[0] or peak == A[-1]:
            return False
  
        for j in range(i, len(A)):
            if A[j] >= peak:
                return False
            else:
                peak = A[j]
        return True
```

## Fourth Solution (Based on the [Third](#Third Solution (Not my solution)))

After looking at the third solution, I decided to write another answer based on the third solution. I cut down the amount of variables, and also made some parts (notably the `len(A) < 3` part) more efficient.

```python
class Solution:   
    def validMountainArray(self, A: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(A) < 3: return False
        
        # Look for peak in mountain array
        for i in range(len(A)-1):
            if A[i] > A[i+1]: break
        
        # Check if mountain is just a hill
        if i == 0 or i == len(A) - 1: return False
        
        # Check if the rest of the slope is strictly decreasing
        while i < len(A)-1:
            if A[i] <= A[i+1]: return False
            i += 1
        
        return True
```
