# Leetcode Problems

A repository of Leetcode problems, along with notes describing how I did it.

I did this according to the [Learn](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/cards), not in the order of their ID's, so I might not have the problems you want. Also, I probably won't have the problems you want, since I've only done a small fraction of all the exercises

## What's in this

In [Problems](/Problems), I'll have all the solutions to completed exercises, mostly written in Java, but some in Python. In all the other directories will contain notes describing the thought process for each problem.
