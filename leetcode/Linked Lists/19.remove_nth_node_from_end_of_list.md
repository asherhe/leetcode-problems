[Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/214/two-pointer-technique/1296/)

Given a linked list, remove the *n*-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example:**

```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Note:**

Given *n* will always be valid.

Could you do this in one pass?

## First Solution

I realized that in able to delete the nth node from the end, I needed two pointers, one to mark the end, one to mark the node n from the end. So how it worked was that they both moved at the same rate, and when the latter hits the end, then the former would be exactly n before the end, which is right before the target. It could then easily be deleted.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        // Main idea: Keep nth and last
        // n nodes apart, when last.next
        // is null, then remove the nth node
        // from the end
        if (head.next == null) {
            return null;
        }
        ListNode nth = head;
        ListNode last = head;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (last.next == null) {
                return head.next;
            }
            n--;
            last = last.next;
        }
        while (last.next != null) {
            last = last.next;
            nth = nth.next;
        }
        nth.next = nth.next.next;
        return head;
    }
}
```

**Results:**

Runtime: **1 ms** (all of them were 1ms)

*(The best one used the same strategy anyways)*
