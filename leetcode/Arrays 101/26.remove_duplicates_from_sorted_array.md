# [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/526/deleting-items-from-an-array/3248/)

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```java
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

## First Solution

A simple program that just iterates through all elements in `nums`. A rather slow solution, even though I don't know why. It *should* be in $O(n)$ time.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Iterate through all elements in nums
        i = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            # Check if current number is in nums (excluding itself)
            if nums[i] in nums[:i] + nums[i+1:]:
                del nums[i]
                i -= 1
            i += 1
        return len(nums)
```

**Results:**

Runtime: **7924 ms** (Was not on the chart, too slow)

## Second Solution

After thinking for a *very* long time, I gave up, so I looked at [this](https://github.com/azl397985856/leetcode/blob/master/problems/26.remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array.md), and so I implemented a two-pointer solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        i = 0
        for j in nums:
            if nums[i] != j:
                i += 1
                nums[i] = j
        return i + 1
```

This has two pointers, `i` and `j`. `i` points at our next position for writing a different number, and `j` points to the number we are looking at. If `i != j`, then we have found a new number, so we increment `i`, then copy `j` into `i`.

**Results:**

# [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array (Again)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/511/in-place-operations/3258/)

Okay, here we go again. Same specification, won't be hard.

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        // Two pointers for copying and pasting (scan is in for loop)
        int copyPos = 0;
        for (int scan = 0; scan < nums.length; scan++) {
            // Check if the two are now unequal
            if (nums[copyPos] != nums[scan]) {
                nums[++copyPos] = nums[scan];
            }
        }
        // Return the length
        return copyPos + 1;
    }
}
```

(Leetcode's Java grader has stable runtime timing, but not memory. Not my problem)
