# [Squares of a Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/511/in-place-operations/3261/)

Given an array of integers `A` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000`
3. `A` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

## First Solution

After some pondering, I decided that I had absolutely no idea how I could implement this, so I just wrote a solution using an additional array (just like most people who *somehow* got the highest memory scores)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] A) {
        int[] result = new int[A.length];
        if (A.length == 1) result[0] = A[0] * A[0];
        int negPointer = 0;
        int posPointer = A.length - 1;
        while (negPointer <= posPointer) {
            if (A[negPointer] >= 0) {
                for (int i = 0; i <= posPointer - negPointer; i++) {
                    result[i] = A[negPointer + i] * A[negPointer + i];
                }
                break;
            } else if (A[posPointer] <= 0) {
                for (int i = 0; i <= posPointer - negPointer; i++) {
                    result[i] = A[posPointer - i] * A[posPointer - i];
                }
                break;
            } else if (-A[negPointer] >= A[posPointer]) {
                result[posPointer - negPointer] = A[negPointer] * A[negPointer];
                negPointer++;
            } else {
                result[posPointer - negPointer] = A[posPointer] * A[posPointer];
                posPointer--;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Second Solution (Formal Solution)

The [formal solution](https://leetcode.com/articles/squares-of-a-sorted-array/) states:

> Since the array `A` is sorted, loosely speaking it has some negative elements with squares in decreasing order, then some non-negative elements with squares in increasing order.
>
> For example, with `[-3, -2, -1, 4, 5, 6]`, we have the negative part `[-3, -2, -1]` with squares `[9, 4, 1]`, and the positive part `[4, 5, 6]` with squares `[16, 25, 36]`. Our strategy is to iterate over the negative part in reverse, and the positive part in the forward direction.

This seems similar to my solution, except that this solution has to look for the start/endpoints of the positive and negative parts. Their solution is:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] A) {
        int N = A.length;
        int j = 0;
        while (j < N && A[j] < 0)
            j++;
        int i = j-1;

        int[] ans = new int[N];
        int t = 0;

        while (i >= 0 && j < N) {
            if (A[i] * A[i] < A[j] * A[j]) {
                ans[t++] = A[i] * A[i];
                i--;
            } else {
                ans[t++] = A[j] * A[j];
                j++;
            }
        }

        while (i >= 0) {
            ans[t++] = A[i] * A[i];
            i--;
        }
        while (j < N) {
            ans[t++] = A[j] * A[j];
            j++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```
