# [Third Maximum Number](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/523/conclusion/3231/)

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, return the **third** maximum number in this array. If it does not exist, return the maximum number. The time complexity must be in O(n).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3, 2, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: The third maximum is 1.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1, 2]

Output: 2

Explanation: The third maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```



**Example 3:**

```
Input: [2, 2, 3, 1]

Output: 1

Explanation: Note that the third maximum here means the third maximum distinct number.
Both numbers with value 2 are both considered as second maximum.
```

## First Solution

After tinkering around for a while, I realized that this problem was *too* hard. So I looked at another solution. That solution used a Set to keep track of the top three numbers. If there was no top *three*, it would just return the maximum. Otherwise, it would return the third greatest value. There is my version of that code:

```java
import java.util.TreeSet;

class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
        TreeSet<Integer> topThree = new TreeSet<Integer>();
        for (int i : nums) {
            topThree.add(i);
            if (topThree.size() > 3) {
                topThree.pollFirst();
            }
        }
        if (topThree.size() == 3) {
            return topThree.first();
        } else {
            return topThree.last();
        }
    }
}
```

## Second Solution (Optimal Solution)

This solution was similar to the first solution, but instead of a Set, three variables were used.

```java
class Solution {
    public int thirdMax(int[] nums) {
        if( nums.length == 0 ) {
            return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        }
        
        long max = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        long secondMax = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        long thirdMax = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        for( int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++ ) {
            if( nums[i] >= max ) {
                if( nums[i] == max ) { continue; }
                thirdMax = secondMax;
                secondMax = max;
                max = nums[i];
            } else if( nums[i] >= secondMax ) {
                if( nums[i] == secondMax ) { continue; }
                thirdMax = secondMax;
                secondMax = nums[i];
            } else if( nums[i] >= thirdMax ) {
                if( nums[i] == thirdMax ) { continue; }
                thirdMax = nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        if( thirdMax == Long.MIN_VALUE ) {
            return (int)max;
        }
        return (int)thirdMax;
    }
}
```
