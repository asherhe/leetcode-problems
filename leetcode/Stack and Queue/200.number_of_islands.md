# [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/231/practical-application-queue/1374/)

Given a 2d grid map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

## First Solution

Well, I had *absolutely no idea* how to do this, so I looked at the discuss. The best answer I found was basically "drown the islands", where you first look for land, then you drown the whole island, and repeat.

```java
// Strategy:
// Find the first "1", then "drown" the
// island with BFS, where a grid is
// "connected" to its direct neighbours
class Solution {
    // A map field so that input is easily
    // accessable
    private char[][] map;

    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        // Copy over to field
        map = grid;
        // Keep track of island count
        int islands = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < map.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < map[0].length; j++) {
                if (map[i][j] == '1') {
                    drownIslands(i, j);
                    islands++;
                }
            }
        }
        return islands;
    }

    private void drownIslands(int x, int y) {
        if (x >= 0 && x < map.length && y >= 0 && y < map[0].length) {
            if (map[x][y] == '1') {
                map[x][y] = '0';
                drownIslands(x - 1, y);
                drownIslands(x + 1, y);
                drownIslands(x, y - 1);
                drownIslands(x, y + 1);
            }
        }
    }    
}
```
